      <p>Now you can imagine the amount of conditions outhere. So here it is very important what is value you are offering to your users.</p>
      <blockquote>
        ‚ÄúWebsite without visitors is like a ship lost in the horizon.‚Äù
        <br><em>Dr. Christopher Dayagdag</em>
        </blockquote>

      <h2>Why should You care about performance</h2>
      <p>There are many possibilities you are offering to your users but there are some other factors those are directly ping to your business. Suppose you created very beautiful website with maximum amount of functionally but what if a user is on slow connection and your website is taking too much time to open. Then guess what your user is going to do?</p>
      <p>Definitely user is going to close the tab and try another one. This is the major issue with maximum website. We are as a developer focusing on features and functionality not on performance. But fact is nobody like slow websites. So performance is something we should take seriously. and finally - "Beautiful should not mean slow."</p>
      <h2>Ux Hierarchy</h2>
      <p>Web performance is all about experience. As you design and develop a new site, you‚Äôll consider many components of its user experience: layout, hierarchy, intuitiveness, ease of use, and more. Your site‚Äôs experience determines how much your audience trusts your brand, returns to your site, and shares it with others.</p>
      <p>Page load time and how fast your site feels is a large part of this user experience and should be weighed equally with the aesthetics of your site. Let's take an example suppose someone search for book online flight. Then how quick user close a tab and go to the next search engine result if a site takes too long to load?</p>
      <img src="../img/Ux-Hierarchy.jpg" alt="Ux Hierarchy">
      <p>How likely is it that user will return to a site that waits forever to show relevant information on your screen? The less time he/she have, the higher your expectations are for a site to load quickly. Then following factor come to the picture :</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How easy it is to find the contant user is looking for</li>
        <li>How well the site fits to screen</li>
        <li>How simple the site is easy to use</li>
        <li>How attractive the site looks</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Are you losing users to your competitors‚Äô sites as you compete in page load time and other aspects of your site‚Äôs user experience? Are you sure that your site is faster than your competitors‚Äô? Good website performance is also represent a good brande value.</p>
      <h2>Retaining Users</h2>
      <p>Pinterest revamped their mobile web experience to focus on performance, and saw an uplift in both user sentiment, and engagement! They increased search engine traffic and sign-ups by 15% when they reduced perceived wait times by 40%.</p>
      <div class="embed-responsive">
        <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3bKMnYJzrqI"></iframe>
    </div>
      <p>Just like Pinteres if you run an online business, then the main goal is to boost revenue / conversion rates. Well, performance is key. Studies have also shown that if users‚Äô experience a delay > 5 seconds to process orders and add to cart, then they are bound to abandon it.</p>
      <p>One thing to take away is that web performance optimization is an art not a science. There is no one laid out path to implementing it . So go ahead, start optimizing your sites and have fun while you‚Äôre at it (if you can üíÅ.)</p>
